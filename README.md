# Explore App

## App description and features

Explore mobile application is developed to provide adequate information about countries around the world to users. Information given are adequate, accurate and up-to-date. Users can view information such as current population, languages, flags, capital, currnecies etc.

## Application Structure

The application has been structured such that the UI components are separated from the logic folder. It also has some controllers for the theme, models, and constants.

Main.dart serves has the entry point to run the application, the first first screen is returned upon successful launch.

## Libraries

For seamless experience onthis application, the following are the dependencies;

1. Getx
2. Shared preferences
3. Get storage
4. HTTP
5. Carousel Slider

## Challenges

Ome of the major challenge i had while developing this application was the data cleaning and model. I was able to resolve it by consulting an online JSON formatter which presented the data properly and also i used app.quicktype to generate the models.
Also had difficulty getting the locale function updated with the translation data supplied from the API.

## Proposed Features

It would nice to have a real time map features which would let users view places, calculate distance and probably have a real navigation feature.

## Notes

The application takes about 2 to 3 minutes to launch on physical device depending on the network. This is due to some data manipulation processes, however this would be optimized in subsequent updates.

Also, to test on appetize.io, kindly set the android version to 12.0 for smooth experience.
